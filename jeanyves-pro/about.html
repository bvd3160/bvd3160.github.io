               Moving to a new country at a young age, Jean-Yves didn't know what to expect.
               Whatever the boy encountered, the goal was always to learn and grow. In a
               new country with a new beginning, Jean-Yves knew that education was the only way
               forward. The only way to make something of himself when he grew older.

                Before finishing High School, Jean-Yves discovered a real passion for technology.
                Upon the end of his High School career, he decided to apply at the Auckland Univerity
                of Technology where he studied Bachelor of Computing and Information Science.
                He majored in Software Development and Information Systems Science.

                His passion is Software development using the SDLC and the Agile methodology.
                Being more versed in Object Oriented Programming using Java, procedural languages are just as fun.
                Other areas of interest include Web Development and Database Management.
